Scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, text processing, machine learning, etc.

DataCleaning.ipynb -- created by Grant to merge our two datasets together, keeping track of shared variables

DataCleaning2.ipynb -- updated file to fix mistakes from first file

Map_Variable_by_Stage.py -- created by Sammy to map the variables from our two datasets to their proper stage (which survey the questions came from), using mappings both done by Sammy and Preethi by hand and from Ilona's files

Summary_Statistics.py -- created by Sammy to run spot checks on age, transcript, and gleason/psa score variables to ensure merged dataset is correct

Compile_transcripts_current.ipynb -- created by Preethi to read in all transcript documents and sort them into one csv file (to be added to previously-merged dataset)
